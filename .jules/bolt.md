## 2024-05-24 - [Firestore Transaction N+1 Queries]
**Learning:** Sequential reads (`await transaction.get()`) inside loops in Firestore transactions create N+1 query performance bottlenecks and can inadvertently violate the strict "read-before-write" SDK constraints if writes (like initializing order docs) are placed before the loop.
**Action:** Always pre-fetch all required documents concurrently at the start of the transaction using `Promise.all` before executing any write operations (`set`, `update`, `delete`).
## 2024-05-24 - [Bento Card Mousemove Optimization]
**Learning:** High-frequency mouse events like `mousemove` that trigger DOM measurements (`getBoundingClientRect`) and style updates (`transform`) cause significant layout thrashing. Wrapping this logic in `requestAnimationFrame` effectively throttles execution to sync with the display refresh rate.
**Action:** Consistently use `requestAnimationFrame` when updating styles continuously based on high-frequency DOM events (like mouse or scroll events) to ensure smooth animations.
## 2025-02-28 - [Dashboard N+1 Fetch Bottleneck]
**Learning:** In dashboards loading multiple independent data sources (like Firebase collections), sequential `await` calls compound latency (N+1 delay).
**Action:** Always fetch independent datasets concurrently using `Promise.allSettled()` to restrict total load time to the duration of the slowest query, preserving isolated error handling per resource.
## 2024-05-24 - [DOM Insertion Loop Bottleneck]
**Learning:** Using `element.innerHTML +=` or `element.appendChild()` in a loop causes O(n²) performance degradation and layout thrashing as the browser parses strings and recalculates layout on every single iteration.
**Action:** When updating lists or rendering multiple components in the frontend, always batch DOM updates. Either accumulate HTML strings in an array, use `Array.prototype.map().join('')`, and apply via a single `.innerHTML` assignment, or use a `DocumentFragment` to batch node appends prior to injecting them into the DOM.
